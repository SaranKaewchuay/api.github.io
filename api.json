        "description": "We present a comprehensive phylogeny derived from 5 genes, nucSSU, nucLSU rDNA, TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2, for 356 isolates and 41 families (six newly described in this volume) in Dothideomycetes. All currently accepted orders in the class are represented for the first time in addition to numerous previously unplaced lineages. Subclass Pleosporomycetidae is expanded to include the aquatic order Jahnulales. An ancestral reconstruction of basic nutritional modes supports numerous transitions from saprobic life histories to plant associated and lichenised modes and a transition from terrestrial to aquatic habitats are confirmed. Finally, a genomic comparison of 6 dothideomycete genomes with other fungi finds a high level of unique protein associated with the class, supporting its delineation as a separate taxon.",

The classification includes 530 species (in 321 genera) to order level: Ascomycota 424 species (in 251 genera), anamorphic fungi 94 species (in 61 genera) and Basidiomycota 12 species (in 9 genera). The Halosphaeriales is the largest order of marine fungi with 126 species in 53 genera, of which 35 are monotypic. Several taxa are of uncertain position and cannot be assigned to any higher taxonomic ranks. The decadel index shows that most marine fungi were described in the period 1980-1989 (135) and 1990-1999 (156), with 43 new species and 25 new genera from the past eight years. Keys are provided to the major taxa, genera and species. One new species is described in this paper.",

        "description": "Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10�15�years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last��",

Fermentation broths from 377 isolated fungi were tested for antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were obtained for crude ethyl acetate extracts. Seventy isolates (18.6%) displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogenic microorganism, such as Staphylococcus aureus, a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. The results revealed that 6�10%, 1�2% and 18% of the crude ethyl acetate extracts inhibited both strains of S. aureus (MIC 32�512 µg mL−1), Ca. albicans and Cr. neoformans (MIC 64�200 µg mL−1), and��",
